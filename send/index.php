 * This serves as an example of how to use the Google API PHP Client

 *
 * The client can be found here:
 * https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client
 *
 * At the time of writing this, there's no Service object for the correct 
 * scope for Firebase Messaging, so here's an example of how this can be
 * done with provididing the scope manually.

 * Info regarding authorization and requests can be found here:
